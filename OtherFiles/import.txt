Flat files: Text, CSV

Excel spreadsheets
SAS
Stata files
HDF5 files

Pickled files
File type native to Python
Motivation: many datatypes for which it it isn't
OBS: JSON is good for Python dictionaries
Pickled files are serialized
Serialize = convert object to bytestream

SAS and Stata files

SAS: Statistical Analysis System
Stata: "Statistics" + "data"

SAS: business analytics and biostatistics
Stata: academic social sciences research

SAS Files:
    Used for:
        Advanced analytics, 
        Multivariate analysis, 
        Business intelligence, 
        Data management, 
        Predictive analytics
    Standard for computational analysis

.sas7bdat   dataset files
.sas7bcat   catalog files

HDF5 Files
    Hierarchical Data Format version 5
    Standard for storing large quantities of numerical data
    Datasets can be hundreds of gigabytes or terabytes
    HDF5 can scale to exabytes

The HDF Project 
    Actively maintained by the HDF Group (The HDF Group)
    Based in Champaign, Illinois

Matlab
    "Matrix Laboratory"
    Industry standard in engineering and science
    Data saved as .mat files
    
    Python dictionary keys      = MATLAB variable names
    Python dictionary values    = MATLAB objects assigned to variables

Use the method .keys() on the dictionary mat to print the keys. 
Most of these keys (in fact the ones that do NOT begin and end with '__') 
are variables from the corresponding MATLAB environment.
